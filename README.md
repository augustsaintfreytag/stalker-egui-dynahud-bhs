# STALKER DynaHUD Changes

A mod for GAMMA x EGUI x DynaHUD x BHS for STALKER Anomaly (Open X-Ray/Monolith engine) that disables the radiation bar, aligns other HUD elements to match, fades the HUD appearance to make it less intrusive, and rewrite DynaHUD's display logic to show and hide HUD elements as a group instead of bars and backgrounds separately. Additionally disables the blinking PDA notification icon.
