# STALKER DynaHUD Changes

A mod for GAMMA x DynaHUD for STALKER Anomaly (Open X-Ray/Monolith engine) that disables the radiation bar, aligns other HUD elements to match, fade the HUD appearance to make it less intrusive, and rewrite DynaHUD's display logic to show and hide HUD elements as a group instead of bars and backgrounds separately.
